Welcome! I am a roboticist/engineer/professor in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.usafa.edu/department/electrical-computer-engineering) at the [United States Air Force Academy](www.usafa.edu). My  research interests include intelligent behavioral control of multiple robots, robust intelligence of multiple heterogeneous unmanned vehicles for navigation, searching, and tracking of multiple targets, and intelligent consensus algorithms for multiple mobile robots.  

I received the Bachelorâ€™s, Masterâ€™s, and Ph.D. degrees ðŸŽ“ from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, [University of California, Berkeley](https:www.berkeley.edu).  My research goal is to develop new techniques to design, build, control, and optimize complex engineering systems, with particular interest in robotics, and more generally systems of collaborating intelligent elements with physical entities to form cyber-physical systems (CPS).  In the future, these systems will make enormous scientific and technical impact on robotics, military tactics, and industrial standards, to name a few.  As with my recent work in cooperative, coordinated control of multiple unmanned vehicles and autonomous flight of a small-scale ornithopter, my research in robotics has drawn heavily on the fields of multiple coordinated control, robust intelligence, machine learning, and behavioral control of multi-agent unmanned vehicles.  These vehicles included fixed-wing, rotary wing, and flapping-wing aerial vehicles as well as bio-inspired crawling and walking robots.

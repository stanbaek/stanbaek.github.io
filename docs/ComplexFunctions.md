# Complex Functions

What is the domain and range of $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$? It's likely that your high school math teacher emphasized that both the domain and range comprise positive real numbers, as illustrated in the plot below:

For engineering students, it's well-known that $\sqrt{x}$ becomes a complex number when $x$ is negative. Consequently, the domain extends across all real numbers, denoted as $(-\infty, \infty)$, and the range encompasses complex numbers, represented as $\mathbb{C}$. Now, let's explore the visualization of $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$. As you're aware, complex numbers can be portrayed in two-dimensional space, where the real part aligns with the $x$-axis, and the imaginary part aligns with the $y$-axis.

Given this, how would you graph $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$? Complex functions need a 3-dimensional representation, as depicted below:

Here, the $x$-axis corresponds to the $x$ values, the $y$-axis to the real part, and the $z$-axis to the imaginary part. Notably, when $x$ is positive, $f(x)$ is always real, while when $x$ is negative, $f(x)$ is consistently imaginary. This distinction adds a layer of understanding to the behavior of the complex function across different domains.

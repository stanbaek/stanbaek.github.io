This course provides a broad understanding of microcontroller systems and embedded programming practices. The microcontroller and programming principles presented provide a foundation that can be used in other courses to simplify and improve projects. This course includes design, application, interfacing, assembly language, C programming language, and microcontroller hardware/subsystems. Laboratory projects emphasize computer architecture implementation, assembly language programming, and microcontroller analysis.

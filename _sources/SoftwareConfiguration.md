```{note}
Donâ€™t worry if it doesnâ€™t work right. If everything did, youâ€™d be out of a job.
```

## ðŸ’» Procedure

### Create Bitbucket Repository

- If you don't already have a <a href="https://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank">Bitbucket</a> account, go ahead and create one.
- Once you have your account, log in to <a href="https://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank">Bitbucket</a>.
- Next, navigate to the following URL: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/stanbaek2/ece487_wksp/src/master/" target="_blank">https://bitbucket.org/stanbaek2/ece487_wksp/src/master/</a>
- At the top right-hand corner of the page, you'll see three dots ($\cdots$). Click on the icon to reveal more options.
- From the dropdown menu, select `Fork this repository`. 
- When prompted, enter "ECE487" for the project name.
- Name the new repository as follows: ECE487_LastName_FirstName.
- Ensure that the access level is set to `Private repository`.
- Give your instructor (Dr. Baek) read access: Click `Invite` and then select `Add members`.
- Enter Dr. Baek's email address, ![baek](https://img.shields.io/badge/stanley.baek@afacademy.af.edu-red), to provide him with read access.

```
<br>

```{important}
Please name your repository as ECE487_LastName_FirstName. This will help instructors find your repository easily.
```

- You may need to create a Bitbucket `app password` as follows.
- Go to `Your Profile` at the top right corner and select `Personal Settings`. 
- Find `App Passwords` and then click on `Create app password`. 
- Write your preferred label and select permissions as needed.
- Click on `Create`.
- Save the password somewhere safe.  You will not be able to see it again after this.

### Install Git

- To download `Git for Windows`  go to <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win" target="_blank">git-scm</a> and click on the link.
- Run the setup file and install Git with the default settings. If you have a Mac, you donâ€™t need to do this step because Git is already installed on your computer.
- Make a new folder called `ece487_wksp` in your home folder, for example, C:\Users\stanley.baek\ece487_wksp.
- Right-click on the `ece487_wksp` folder and choose `Git Bash Here` from the menu.   
- In Bitbucket, open your repository and click on Clone. Copy the command that starts with _git clone_ by clicking on the copy button. 
- Paste the command on the Bash terminal (you can use middle-click, right-click > Paste, or Shift+Ins to paste) and add a space and a **_dot_** at the end.  The **_dot_** means that you want to clone the repository into the **_current folder_**. Press Enter.
- If it asks for a password, type in the app password that you saved before.
- Notice that you have `(master)` at the end of the folder name. 
- Note: The gif animation below is from ECE382. You should use ECE487 instead of ECE382.

- The figure below shows an example of a local `ece487_wksp` folder on your computer.

```{image} ./figures/workspace_folder.png

:align: center
```

<br>

- Go back to the Git Bash terminal. If you have already closed it, right-click on an empty area inside the `ece487_wksp` folder and pick `Git Bash Here` from the menu.
- Type in `git remote -v` and press Enter.  You should see two lines that say `origin` is your remote repository on bitbucket.org for both fetching and pushing. 
- Type in `git remote add upstream https://stanbaek2@bitbucket.org/stanbaek2/ece487_wksp.git` (or copy & paste) and press Enter.  This will add the instructorâ€™s repository as another remote source.
- Type in `git remote -v` and press Enter.  You should now see two more lines that say upstream is the original repository that you forked from.
- Note: The gif animation below has been adpated from ECE382. You must use ECE487 in place of ECE382.

```{image} ./figures/GitAddUpstream.gif

:align: center
```
<br>

- If the instructorâ€™s code changes, you will be notified and you need to run `git fetch upstream` to get the latest updates on your local files.
- When you push or pull your code, you will use origin, which is your own Bitbucket repository.

### Install and Configure VS Code

- To get Python 3.11, go to <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">python.org</a> and click on the download button. Run the file and follow the steps to install it on your computer.
- To get VS Code, go to <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">VS Code</a> and click on the download button for your operating system. Run the file and follow the steps to install it on your computer.
- When you install VS Code, make sure you check the last four boxes as shown in the picture below. This will let you use VS Code with Python and Git more easily.

```{image} ./figures/VSCode_Setup.png

:align: center
```
<br>

- To open the `ece487_wksp` folder with VS Code, right-click on it and choose `Open with Code` from the menu.
- To open the `Show All Commands` menu, go to Help and click on it, or press `Shift+Ctrl+P`. This is a useful menu that you will use a lot, so remember the shortcut `Shift+Ctrl+P`.
- To create a virtual environment for Python, type in the first few letters of `Python: Create Environment` in the `Show All Commands` menu and select it.
- Pick `Venv` to create a virtual environment.  
- Select the Python path that you want to use.  
- Select `requirements.txt` to install the Python packages that you need for this course.
- Wait for a few minutes until all the packages are installed.
- Click on the gear icon at the bottom left corner and select `Settings`. 
- Selct the `workspace` tab and click on the turn page icon at the top right corner. This will open `settings.json` 
- To copy the code for the virtual environment settings, open vscode.md and copy the code inside the curly brackets.
- Paste the code into settings.json and save it. This will make sure that the virtual environment starts automatically when you open the workspace.

<br>

- Open `README.md` and type in your name for author.  To save the file, press `Ctrl+s`.
- You should see the number 1 next to the `Source Control` icon.  Click on the `Source Control` icon and type in "initial commit".  
- Click on the arrow next to the `Commit` button and pick `Commit & Push` on the drop down menu.  

```{image} ./figures/GitCommitPush.gif

```
<br>

- You can accomplish the same thing in `Git Bash`. 
- Open `Git Bash` and type in `git add -A` or `git add -all` and press `Enter`.
- Type in `git commit -m "Initial commit."` and press `Enter`.
- Type in `git push` and press `Enter`
- Enter your username and password if prompted.

There are also many third-party graphic user interface (GUI) clients. Check out https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis.
```

```{Attention} 
It is your responsibility to check your files have been successfully pushed to your Bitbucket repository. Always visit your Bitbucket repository after you push your assignments to the repository.
```

## ðŸšš Deliverables

Take screenshots of the following and submit them via Gradescope.  Use `Snip & Sketch` (Win+Shift+S) in Windows 10 or Shift+CMD+4 in Mac to take a screenshot. Save it in `png` or `jpg`.  

```{warning}
Snap a picture of your computer screen with a mobile device or digital camera and then upload it to Gradescope. This will show that you have no idea what sampling aliasing (a concept covered in ECE215) is and you are not qualified for a bachelor's degree in ECE. You will lose 30 points every time you submit a picture of a computer screen taken by your phone or mobile device. And yes, I'm quite serious about this.
```

### Deliverable 1
- Provide a screenshot of your Bitbucket repository as shown below 
```{image} ./figures/BitbucketPushed.png

```

<br>

### Deliverable 2
- Provide a screenshot of your VS Code as shown below. Make sure you have the `.venv` and `.vscode` folders under the `EXPLORER` window.

# Functions are Vectors?

a function space inherently constitutes a vector space. In mathematical terms, a function space encompasses a collection of functions united by a shared property. When this set of functions is endowed with the operations of addition and scalar multiplication, it forms a vector space. This implies that the set of functions adheres to the fundamental vector space axioms, including closure under addition and scalar multiplication, associativity, commutativity, and the presence of additive and multiplicative identities. Hence, it can be unequivocally asserted that a function space is, indeed, a vector space.

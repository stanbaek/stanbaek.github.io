## String Formatting
- Python offers multiple ways to format strings. Here are some common methods:

    ```python
    title = "The legendary pirate captain"
    age = 726.25

    # method 1: (formatted-string)%(values)
    print("%s is %f years old."%(title, age))     # print a string and a floating point
    print("%s is %.4f years old."%(title, age))   # 4 decimal places
    print("%s is %10.4f years old."%(title, age)) # allocate 10 spaces
    print("%s is %d years old."%(title, age))     # print it as integer
    print("%s is %10d years old."%(title, age))   # allocate 10 spaces

    # method 2: (formatted-string).format(values)
    print("{} is {} years old.".format(title, age)) 
    print("{} is {:0.4f} years old.".format(title, age))
    print("{} is {:10.4f} years old.".format(title, age))

    # method 3: f(formatted-string with values)
    print(f"{title} is {age} years old.")
    print(f"{title} is {age:.4f} years old.")
    print(f"{title} is {age:10.4f} years old.")
    ```
- Output:
    ```
    The legendary pirate captain is 726.250000 years old.
    The legendary pirate captain is 726.2500 years old.
    The legendary pirate captain is   726.2500 years old.
    The legendary pirate captain is 726 years old.
    The legendary pirate captain is        726 years old.
    The legendary pirate captain is 726.25 years old.
    The legendary pirate captain is 726.2500 years old.
    The legendary pirate captain is   726.2500 years old.
    The legendary pirate captain is 726.25 years old.
    The legendary pirate captain is 726.2500 years old.
    The legendary pirate captain is   726.2500 years old.
    ```

## Pythonic Coding

`"Pythonic"` refers to writing code in a way that is idiomatic and aligns with the principles and style of the Python programming language. It emphasizes readability, simplicity, and elegance, often leveraging Python‚Äôs unique features and conventions. 

### Example: List Comprehensions

1. Non-Pythonic:
    ```Python
    squares = []
    for i in range(10):
        squares.append(i * i)
    ```
1. Pythonic:
    ```Python
    squares = [i * i for i in range(10)]
    ```

### Simplifying Conditional Statements
1. Consider the following code:
    ```Python
    hand = input("What would you like to play? ")
    if hand == "Rock":
        print("It is a valid play.")
    elif hand == "Paper":
        print("It is a valid play.")
    elif hand == "Sciccors":
        print("It is a valid play.")
    else:    
        print("It is an invalid play.")
    ```
1. This code can be simplified by
    ```Python
    hand = input("What would you like to play? ")
    if hand == "Rock" or hand == "Paper" or hand == "Sciccors":
        print("It is a valid play")
    else:    
        print("It is an invalid play")
    ```
1. This code can be further simplified using Python's `in` keyword:
    ```Python
    hand = input("What would you like to play? ")  # This is Pythonic
    if hand in  ("Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"):  
        print("It is a valid play")
    else:    
        print("It is an invalid play")    
    ```

### Ternary Operator
The ternary operator allows concise conditional assignments:

1. Consider the following code:
    ```Python
    y = 1

    if y == 1:
        x = 1
    else: 
        x = 0
    print(x)
    ```
1. The code can be simplified using `Pythonic` by
    ```Python
    x = 1 if y == 1 else 0  # This is Pythonic
    print(x)
    ```

### Loops

1. If you would like to use index in a loop:
    ```Python
    # indexing using for loops
    names = ['Peter Parker', 'Clark Kent', 'Wade Wilson', 'Bruce Wayne', 'Dr. Baek']
    index = 0
    for name in names:
        print(index, name)
        index += 1
    ```
1. This will print
    ```
    0 Peter Parker
    1 Clark Kent
    2 Wade Wilson
    3 Bruce Wayne
    4 Dr. Baek
    ```
1. You can also use `enumerate()` for more `Pythonic` code:
    ```Python
    names = ['Peter Parker', 'Clark Kent', 'Wade Wilson', 'Bruce Wayne', 'Dr. Baek']
    for index, name in enumerate(names):
        print(index, name)
    ```
1. This will print the same.
1. You can also start the index from 1:
    ```Python
    names = ['Peter Parker', 'Clark Kent', 'Wade Wilson', 'Bruce Wayne', 'Dr. Baek']
    for index, name in enumerate(names, start=1):
        print(index, name)
    ```
1. This will print
    ```
    1 Peter Parker
    2 Clark Kent
    3 Wade Wilson
    4 Bruce Wayne
    5 Dr. Baek
    ```

### Iterating Through Multiple Lists
1. You can iterate through multiple lists:
    ```Python
    heroes = ['Spiderman', 'Superman', 'Deadpool', 'Batman', 'Pirate Captain']
    for index, name in enumerate(names):
        hero = heroes[index]
        print(f'{name} is actually {hero}')
    ```
1. It will print
    ```
    Peter Parker is actually Spiderman
    Clark Kent is actually Superman
    Wade Wilson is actually Deadpool
    Bruce Wayne is actually Batman
    Dr. Baek is actually Pirate Captain
    ```
1. You can the `Pythonic` style to iterate through multiple lists using `zip()`:
    ```Python
    # Pythonic with zip
    for name, hero in zip(names, heroes):
        print(f'{name} is actually {hero}')
    ```
1. This will print the same.
1. Another example:
    ```Python
    universes = ['Marvel', 'DC', 'Marvel', 'DC', 'USAFA']
    for name, hero, universe in zip(names, heroes, universes):
        print(f'{name} is actually {hero} from {universe}')
    ```
1. This will print
    ```
    Peter Parker is actually Spiderman from Marvel
    Clark Kent is actually Superman from DC
    Wade Wilson is actually Deadpool from Marvel
    Bruce Wayne is actually Batman from DC
    Dr. Baek is actually Pirate Captain from USAFA
    ```


## Python Data Containers

### Strings

1. Strings are created by enclosing characters in single, double, or triple quotes:
    ```python
    a = "Hellow World"
    b = 'Python is groovy'
    c = """Computer says 'No'"""
    print(a, b, c)
    ```

1. The same type of quote used to start a string must be used to terminate it.  Triple-quoted strings capture all the text that appears prior to the terminating triple quote, as opposed to single- and double-quoted strings, which must be  specified on one logical line.  Triple-quoted strings are useful when the contents of a string literal span multiple lines of text such as the following:

    ```python
    print('''Content-type: text/html

    <h1> Hello World </h1>
    Click <a href="http://www.python.org">here</a>.
    ''')
    ```

1. Strings are stored as sequences of characters indexed by integers starting at zero

    ```python
    a = "Hello World"
    print(a[0])   # First character
    print(a[:5])  # Slice: 'Hello'  
    print(a[6:])  # Slice: 'World'
    print(a[3:8]) # Slice: 'lo Wo' 
    ```

1. Try this:
    ```python
    x = "37"
    y = "42"
    z = x+y
    print(z) # what does this print?  why?
    z = int(x)+int(y)
    print(z)  # what does this print?
    ```

### Lists
1. Lists are `mutable` sequences of objects, created with square brackets:
    ```python
    names = ["Dave", "Mark", "Ann", "Phil"]
    print(names)
    ```
1. Lists are indexed by integers, starting with zero. Use the indexing operator to access and modify individual items of the list:
    ```python
    a = names[2]
    print(a)
    names[0] = "Jeff"
    names.append("Paula")
    names.insert(2, "Thomas")
    print(names)
    ```
1. Lists can be sliced and concatenated using:
    ```Python
    x[start:stop:stride]
    ```
1. For example,
    ```python
    b = names[0:2]
    print(b)
    c = names[2:]
    print(c)
    names[1] = 'Jeff'
    print(names)
    names[0:2] = ['Dave', 'Mark', 'Jeff']
    print(names)
    ```
1. Use the plus `+` operator to concatenate lists: 
    ```python
    a = [1,2,3]+[4,5,6]
    print(a)
    ```
1. An empty list can be created by one of two ways
    ```python
    names = []
    print(names)
    names = list()
    print(names)
    ```
1. Lists can contain any kind of Python object, including other lists, as in the following example:
    ```python
    a = [1, "Dave", 3.14, ["Mark", 7, 9, [0, 101]], 10]
    ```
1. Items contained in nested lists are accessed by applying more than one indexing operation, as follows:

    ```python
    print(a[1])
    print(a[3])
    print(a[3][1])
    print(a[3][3][1])
    ```
1. Objects can be inserted and appended to a list.
    ```python
    # List methods (insert)
    list_b.insert(2,'python')
    print(list_b)
    # List methods (append)
    list_b.append('.')
    print(list_b)
    ```

### Tuples
1. To create simple data structures, you can pack a collection of values together into a single object using a *tuple*. You can create a tuple by enclosing group of values in parentheses like this: 

    ```python
    stock = ("GOOG", 100, 490.10)
    address = ('www.python.org', 80)
    person = ("Stan", "Baek", "stanley.baek@afacademy")
    ```
1. Python often recognizes that a tuple is intended even if the parentheses are missing
    ```python
    stock = "GOOG", 100, 490.10
    address = 'www.python.org', 80
    person = "Stan", "Baek", "stanley.baek@afacademy"
    ```
1. For completeness, 0- and 1-element tuples can be defined, but have special syntax:
    ```python
    a = ()    # 0-tuple, empty tuple
    b = (1,)  # 1-tuple  
    c = 1,    # 1-tuple
    print(type(a))
    print(type(b))
    print(type(c))
    b = (1)   # not a tuple
    c = 1     # not a tuple
    print(type(b))
    print(type(c))
    ```

1. The values in a tuple can be extracted by numerical index just like a list. However, it is more common to unpack tuples into a set of variables like this
    ```python
    name, shares, price = stock
    host, port = address
    first_name, last_name, phone = person
    ```
1. Although tuples support most of the same operations as lists, such as indexing, slicing, and concatenation, the contents of a tuple `cannot be modified` after creation.  That is, you cannot replace, delete, or append new elements to an exisiting tuple. 

    ```python
    print(stock[1]) 
    stock[1] = 200  # error
    ```

```{note}
Python tuples and strings are `immutable`. This means that once it is created, its contents cannot be changed ‚Äî elements cannot be added, removed, or altered.  On the other hand, Python lists are `mutable`.
```

### Dictionaries
- In Python, a dictionary (or dict) is mapping between a set of indices (keys) and a set of values
- The items in a dictionary are key-value pairs
- Keys can be any Python data type
- Dictionaries are unordered

1. We can create a dictionary using curly braces:
    ```python
    eng2sp = {'one': 'uno', 'two': 'dos', 'three': 'tres'}
    print(eng2sp['one'])  # Output: uno
    ```
1. An empty dictionary can be created:
    ```python
    # Dictionaries
    eng2sp = {}
    eng2sp['one'] = 'uno'
    print(eng2sp)
    ```
1. Keys can be retrieved using `.keys()` and values using `.values()`:
    ```python
    # keys vs values
    print(eng2sp.keys())
    print(eng2sp.values())
    ```

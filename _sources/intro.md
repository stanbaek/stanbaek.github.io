## 📡 Communication
- All communication and announcement 📣 will be provided through a course and section Team.
- All lecture 📓 materials will be provided through MS Teams.
- Laboratory 🔬 work will be posted on this course web.
- All assignments must be submitted in [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com)
- [Bitbucket](https://www.bitbucket.com) will be used for students to provide their source code 📄 for homework and laboratory assignments.
- Videos 🎥 will be uploaded to a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcfQyc3R-tA&list=PLdXU2qMgwlRtIJIXX8bZWp8W-YwxSDODq&ab_channel=StanBaek) for your convenience.


## ⏰ Late Policy:  
**If problems arise with graded assignments, see your instructor in advance**

- The cutoff for **on-time submission is 07:00 🕖 a.m.** on the due date. 
- Late days are counted in 24-hour periods. Submitting between 07:00:01 on the due date and 07:00:00 the next day is one day late, and so on.
- You are given **5 grace days (self-granted extensions)** which you can use to give yourself extra time without penalty. No more than **2 grace days** can used for each assignment.
- Instructor-granted extensions are only considered after all grace days are used and only given in exceptional situations. Computer problems such as hard-drive reimaging are **not** considered as exceptional situations and you must use grace days.
- Late work handed in when you have run out of grace is 💥 **discounted 25% for the first day late and 10% per day late thereafter**.
- Every assignment has a hard deadline; **4 days** past the original due date. 
- Late submissions (penalty or not) are not accepted after the hard deadline or after the solution to the assignment is published. No late submissions (penalty or not) will be accepted for the assignments right before GRs.

## 📄 Documentation Requirements

- All help received on work submitted for grading must be documented in accordance with the course documentation policy. 
- Each documentation statement must be specific enough that it explicitly describes what assistance was provided, how it was used in completing the assignment, and who provided the assistance.
- If no help was received on this assignment, the documentation statement must state “None.”
- If you checked answers with anyone, you must document with whom on which problems. You must document whether you made any changes or not.  If you did make changes, you must document the problems you changed and the reasons why.
- Vague documentation statements will result in a 5% deduction on the assignment.

## 🔑 Recommendations from 22ers - `Homework!!`

- Just do the $\color{red}{\text{homework}}$ and don't take grace days on homework assignments if you don't absolutely have to, it'll just set you back more.
- linear algebra
- Go in for help when you need it. Dr. Baek is great at explaining things even when you fall behind.
- If writing in notetakers is your learning style, ask for them earlier in the semester.
- Doing all the $\color{red}{\text{homework}}$, asking questions when you're confused
- Using the lesson slides and going in for EI as sometimes the slides dont cover everything
- I would recommend using notetakers in class, and prioritizing the $\color{red}{\text{homework}}$ and getting EI early.
- Make sure to do the homework!
- Start $\color{red}{\text{homework}}$ early and don't get discouraged by the amount of math
- I would recommend to go over the notetakers especially while doing homework in order to succeed in this course.
- Get help early, dont fall behind, be good at coding matlab and python.
- Work together but don't copy.
- start early, don't take too many difficult classes.
- Do NOT wait to start $\color{red}{\text{homework}}$/labs/projects. As soon as you learn the material attempt it so you can ask questions. Also don't rely on grace days, use them only when it is a necessity.
- start early! Ask questions??
- Stay on top of the $\color{red}{\text{homework}}$, labs, and ICEs because they build on eachother and go pretty quickly!
- Students should "dig into" python as soon and as quickly as they can (don't hesitate).
- Keep up with the class and use grace days strategically.
